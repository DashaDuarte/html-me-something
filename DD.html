    <p> I had been dreaming about High school all summer! Me and my friends were excited to start our new journey and my parents couldn't stop talking about how proud they were of me and how I was growing up so fast. I went shopping with my mom the week before for new school clothes and school supplies. I was excited but nervous all at once. The night before I called my best friend to see if she was feeling the same way. She was nervous too! What if we got lost going to class? What if we didn't have the same classes together? WHAT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE LUNCH PERIOD TOGETHER?!.  </p>

    <p>The next morning I put on my new outfit and headed out to meet Dejanae and the rest of our friends. After looking at our schedules ,we realized we all had the same classes together including lunch ; school was going to be a breeze after all and I was going to have my friends there with me every step of the way! I had no reason to be so nervous after all.......Or so I thought.</p>

    <p>We had avoided the Gross sisters all day. The school bullies. After hearing rumors about them earlier that day on the bus, we were on the look out all times and dodged out of site if either one of us saw them. Unfortunatly , they had the same fourth period as us-Dance class. Before I knew it they had us cornered. Class started in ten minutes and the teacher was no where in site!" Cough up the money now chumps", they snickered. Then the weirdest thing happened. Our teacher appeared out of nowhere and yelled" Dance for it!",from the back of the class. We all turned to look at her so confused. Was she serious? 
        She wanted us to have a full on dance battle and if we lost then we had to give the Gross Sisters what they wanted. In turn she got to see our dance skills. We all agreed and decided on a routine we had been practicing all summer.

        <p> The whole class loved our routine! Half way through our set we didn't even realize that the Gross sisters snuck out because they were too afraid to dance in front of public.Lucky for us! We were already the teachers favorite and we had stood up the 
            biggest bullies in school. We were so proud ourselves. We went home with the biggest smiles ever and knew without a doubt that High School really was going to be a breeze.
